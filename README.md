# React blog

Having fun with React on my free time.

* Material-UI (MUI) for ready to use react components
* Redux for handling state

To run this (NodeJs 18.14.2):

    npm install
    npm run serve

If you have something cool to share or something you would do differently, let me know, I would love to hear it. :blush:

# Goal

* Have fun (enjoy the process) 
* Reinvent the wheel a little bit (for fun)
* Maybe do some overkills (for fun)

# Non-goals

* Become a JS or React master
* Testing suites

### Footnote to recruiters 
 
This is not necessarily representative on how I would build or make decisions for production applications/solutions. I do these tiny projects for personal enjoyment and to scratch my itchy curious brain, using the little free time I have.
